#Program to print Fibonacci Numbers

#Function to generate Fibonacci numbers
def generate_fibonacci(n):
#Initial two Fibonacci numbers
a = 0
b = 1
count = 0  #To keep track of how many numbers have been printed

print("Fibonacci sequence")

# Using a while loop to generate Fibonacci numbers
while count < n:
#Print the current Fibonacci number
print(a, end=" ")

#update the count
count +=1

# Calculate the next Fibonacci number
c = a + b

# Update a and b for the next loop
a = b
b = c

# Main part of the program
# Ask the user for the number of terms they want
num_terms = int(input("Enter how many Fibonacci numbers to generate: "))

# Check if the input is valid
if num_terms <= 0:
print("Please enter a positive integer.")
else:
